Name: Blocky Autonomous and Driver Code VEX Team 86759B

Language: blocky (generated as Python)

Description:
These photos and a copy of the generated text show the source code for our robot in the 2019-2020 VEX Robotics competitions. I was the one who wrote the code for that year. This was the last computer program I wrote in a blocky programming language before graduating to text based programming. Our team won a Tournament Championship award in a regional competition on February 8th, 2020. This qualified us for the state competition.

Attached are photos of the blocky code, as well as a text file for the generated python text.

User information: This program can only be run via a Robot Mesh download on VEX V5 hardware. It will only work properly on a robot with the same mechanical configurations.
